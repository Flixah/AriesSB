# Aries SB
##  Aries Selfbot, Discord Revised.
### Aries selfbot was a project i started when i knew little about python, i opensrc this now to reflect and look at how much I improved at coding, Aries has some decent features but the code is a bit messy, parts of this are skidded and or taken but very few parts are. Aries is not the best nor that good but I think its time I stop further development and or recodes of this project.
# Features
### Nitro Sniper
### Moderation
### Decent GUI
### & More.
