# Aries SB
##  Aries Selfbot, Discord Revised.
### Aries selfbot was a project i started when i knew little about python, i opensrc this now to reflect and look at how much I improved at coding, Aries has some decent features but the code is a bit messy, parts of this are skidded and or taken but very few parts are. Aries is not the best nor that good but I think its time I stop further development and or recodes of this project. It was fun while it lasted, but this project was mainly to have fun, and learn further about Python, I now will move to bigger and better projects to come.
